The patient has left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. In left-sided or left ventricular heart failure, the left side of the heart LV Dysfunction must work harder to pump the same amount of blood. The two types of LV dysfunction are systolic (reduced ejection fraction -HFrEF) and diastolic (preserved ejection fraction - HFpEF) heart failure. The patient has experienced syncope, a temporary loss of consciousness usually related to insufficient blood flow to the Syncope brain. It\u2019s also called fainting or \"passing out\". Post Cardiac Transplant The patient has received a cardiac transplant. Pre-operative evaluation The patient requires cardiac evaluation of the coronary arteries and/or LV function.
